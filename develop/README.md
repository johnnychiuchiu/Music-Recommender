music recommender
==============================

The goal of the project is to help people discover the music they may enjoy by providing them a list of recommended songs according to their favorite musicians and songs.

Get Data
------------
* Go to `src/data` folder, run
```
> python create_db.py
> python insert_data.py
```
* The data will be populated under `develop/data` folder 

Documentation
------------
* `latentFactorModel.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook that contains a walkthrough of the overall process. [[jupyter notebook](https://github.com/johnnychiuchiu/Music-Recommender/blob/sprint_1/develop/notebooks/latentFactorModel.ipynb)]
