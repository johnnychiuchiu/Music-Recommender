**Mission**

The goal of the project is to help people discover the music they may enjoy by providing them a list of recommended songs according to their favorite musicians and songs. This will be done using a collaborative filtering or a latent factor recommender model that is trained with the [Million Song Dataset](https://www.google.com/search?q=million+song+dataset&oq=million+so&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i60l2j69i61j69i57j0.5455j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).
